Based on the table schema below, question, SQL query, and SQL response, write a natural language response:
{schema}

Question: {question}
SQL Query: {query}
SQL Response: {response}
The username of the person who asked the question is: {username}
Mention the username of the person when addressing them in your response by saying hi.
RULES:
- Don't say 'SQL' and 'table names' in your response.
- Don't say 'analysis based on sql' in your response.
- Your response is directly read by clients with no technical background so 
avoid using sql terms and other complex stuff and just make your answer as 
clear and concise as possible and as human response.

Now generate me a response.
