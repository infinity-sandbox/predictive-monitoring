Dashboard Guide
===============

1. **Accessing the Dashboard**  
   Click on the "Enter to the Dashboard" button located at the center of the screen to access the dashboard.

2. **Entering Parameters**  
   You will be prompted to input two details:
   - The number of days from the current date for which you want predictions.
   - The prediction column (the problem you want to investigate).

3. **Processing Time**  
   Wait approximately 2-3 minutes, depending on the dataset size, for the dashboard to load.

4. **Dashboard Layout**  
   The dashboard is divided into two sections:
   - Top Section
     On the left, you will see the prediction line chart for the selected column. On the right, the dashboard displays causal features that directly impact the predictions for the selected column.
   
   - Bottom Section
     This area features three line charts representing the predictions for the causes related to the selected column.

NOTE: 
At times, when you select a specific column in the dropdown along with the number of days to predict, 
the result may not appear. This occurs because the selected column is deemed irrelevant by the AI for that 
particular period, and it is excluded accordingly.
