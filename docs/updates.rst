Updates on this version
=======================
- Implement color coding and display only the training and predicted data.
- Optimize prediction speed to eliminate the need for a separate page or radio button for the 
  data dashboard (all-in-one solution).
- Add chat functionality to provide context on causes and problems. This allows the 
  admin to inquire about current issues or those within the last 3 minutes and, subsequently, 
  ask about the causes of any identified problems.
